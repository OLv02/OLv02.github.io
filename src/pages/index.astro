			<h1>🧑‍🚀 Welcome to my Website!</h1>
			<p>
				I think learning is only complete when the lesson is shared, and hope this site helps me (and you) to "close the loop". In today's informational environment I don't think another website is the solution, but to build anything with anyone you need somewhere to point to and refer from.  
			</p>
			<p>Astro has given me a few ideas on how to get started with the template, which I hope to explore:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
			</ul>
		</main>
		<Footer />
	</body>
