	<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Owen, and I think learning is only complete when the lesson is shared. In today's information environment I don't think the world needs another blog, but I hope this will give me somewhere to point people if they want to know more about what I'm thinking.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few things I'm thinking about right now:
		<ul>
			<li>Attention and prioritization in a world that's optimized for interruption.</li>
			<li>The informational environment—how the Internet changed what we notice, how we decide, and what institutions can realistically do.</li>
			<li>Local-first MVPs that can streamline the way we work </li>
			<li>international institutions, international business, and geopolitics - more frameworks than hot takes.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
		Some long-running interests:
		<ul>
			<li>Dance (as practice, structure, and craft)</li>
			<li>Architecture (especially soviet and other modernist forms)</li>
			<li>Sharks</li>
			<li>international institutions, international business, and geopolitics - more frameworks than hot takes.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
